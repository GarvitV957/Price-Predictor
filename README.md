# Price-Predictor
Ml based project which uses regression technique to predict the price.
I have used various regression models and finds the model with lower rmse so as to predict the prices better as possible.
* I have used flask for deployimg the model over web page created through html and css.
* When user will enter the features of house and hit the predict button, the predicted price lable will be shown to the user.

## Thanks
